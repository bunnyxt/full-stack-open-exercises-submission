Pros:
- Well organized full-stack knowledge and carefully designed guidelines.
- Progressive exercises, that is so great and impressive!
- Advanced web knowledge, framework and many new things.
- Enjoyable web UI.

Cons:
- Too many translation mistakes in Chinese, especially in part 6, 7.
- Redux is quite difficult for me! Hoping this part will be better described.

Thanks to all staff!
